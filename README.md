# Iris_Flower
This project aims to implement basics of supervised machine learning through KNN model on a data of different types of iris flowers

Models and Functions used are:
1) Data visualisation using seaborn
2) Comparison of different parameters of the flowers and recognising trends using pairplot
3) Buliding KNN model from scratch
4) Using scikit learn to predict the type of flower
5) Finding accuracy of above predicted result
